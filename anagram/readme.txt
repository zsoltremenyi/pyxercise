Create a program that compares two strings and determines if the two strings are anagrams.
The program should prompt for both input strings and display the output.

constraints:
Implement the program using a function called isAnagram, which takes in two words as its arguments and returns true or false.
Invoke function from your main program.
Check that both words are the same length.

challenge:
Complete this program without using built-in language features. Use selection or repetition logic instead and
develop your own algorithm.
