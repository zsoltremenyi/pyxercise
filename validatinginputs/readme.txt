Write a program that prompts for a first name, last name,
amployee ID, and ZIP code. Ensure that the input is valid according
to these rules:

The first name must be filled in.
The last name must be filled in.
The first and last names must be at least two characters long.
An employee ID is in the format AA-1234. So, two letters,
a hyphen, and four numbers.
The ZIP code must be a number.

Display appropriate error messages on incorrect data.

Constraints:

Create a function for each type of validation you need to write.
Then create a validatInput function that takes in
all of the input data and invokes the specific validation functions.
Use a single output statement to display the outputs.

Challenges:

Use regular expressions to validate the input.
Repeat the process if the input is not valid.
