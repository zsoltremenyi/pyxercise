Create a program that generates a secure password. Prompt
the user for the minimum length, the number of special
characters, and the number of numbers. Then generate a
password for the user using those inputs.

Constraints
Use lists to store the characters you'll use to generate
the passwords.
Add some randomness to the password generation.

Challenges
Have the program present a few options rather than a single result.
Place the password on the user's clipboard when generated.
