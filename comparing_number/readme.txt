write a program that asks for three numbers. Check first, to see that all numbers are different.
If they're not different, then exit the program. Otherwise, display the largest number of the three.

contraint:
write the algorithm manually. Don't use a built-in function for finding the largest number in a list.

challenges:
Modify the program so that all entered values are tracked and the user is prevented from entering a
number that's already been entered.
Modify the program so that it asks for ten numbers instead of three.
Modify the program so that it asks for an unlimited number of numbers.
